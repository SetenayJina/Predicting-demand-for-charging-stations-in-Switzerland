# Predicting demand for charging stations in Switzerland


!(./src/newplot.png)


#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the future demand for charging stations in municipalities in Switzerland based in charging infrastructure that is currently available and the growth rate of electric car stock.

Assumptions: 
- current charging infrastructure is sufficient for current vehicle stock, 
- predictions are based on the electric vehicle stock growth rate from 2016 to 2021.

""""""nice to have: 
- build a prediction model for historical data for car sales
- add green energy sources
- narrow down prediction from municipality to location within municipality (based in distance between the stations, etc.)
- visualisation: car sales per municipality, charging stations per municipality, prediction for new charging stations

## Project Description

Data sources:
- charging stations available in Switzerland https://opendata.swiss/fr/dataset/ladestationen-fuer-elektroautos
- current stock of electric cars in Switzerland https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/de/px-x-1103020100_111/px-x-1103020100_111/px-x-1103020100_111.px/
- Swiss municipalities https://datahub.io/cividi/ch-municipalities

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages)
create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
